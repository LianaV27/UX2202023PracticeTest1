    <h1>Emphasis and strengthened text</h1>
    <p>Using the tags for <strong>strong</strong> and <em>emphasis</em> is a better choice than using the italics and
        bold tags because the former
        tags signal the importance and describe the effect of the affected text better than the latter ones through the
        name of the tags.
        <strong>Bolding</strong> a word or phrase creates a strong effect. It gives the word both figurative and literal
        weight, drawing attention to it
        and implying importance. Using <em>italics</em> creates emphasis, telling readers that this word or phrase is
        important, while often indicating a change
        in tone and the connotation of the word or phrase.
