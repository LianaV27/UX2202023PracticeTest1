    <h1>Writing in Google Docs Vs. html</h1>
    <h2>... Separating content from presentation</h2>
    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The key differences between writing in Google Docs and in an html document are rooted in formatting. Google Docs
        is a word processor that allows
        users to easily change the format of their written piece with buttons, making it simple for those who know
        nothing about html. This gives users
        a nice, clean space to focus on writing the content needed for their project. When it comes to html, a lot of
        time is spent formatting,
        manually changing the font, the colours, the headings, and more. Having these commands written in the document
        alongside the content can make for
        a messier-seeming experience. It can be more difficult to focus on writing the content in this environment.
